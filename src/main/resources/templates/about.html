            <p>

                This project was created as part of a <strong>Databases class</strong> at Otterbein. The goal of the project was to build a dynamic, data-driven web application utilizing database technologies to manage user-generated content, such as recipes and images. The site uses Thymeleaf and Spring Boot to create a seamless experience for users, while MySQL handles the backend data storage.
